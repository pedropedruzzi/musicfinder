This work proposes a new way of comparing audio content composed by melodies, basing on adaptative techniques, specifically, using a adptative automata. For the evaluation of this method a prototype of an audio content based search system is proposed, comprehending the audio capture, the comparison, the search and the selection of the most similar content.

The architecture of this prototype is presented, as well as the details of each component, showing the operation and presenting the results of each phase of the process. A major focus is given to the adaptative comparison component, nevertheless, the work still presents a prototype which may validates the proposed concepts, besides enabling the evaluation of the process performance as whole.
