This work proposes a novel method to compare monophonic music excerpts, based on adaptive techniques, specifically, using an adptative automaton. For the evaluation of this method, a prototype of a content-based music search engine is presented, comprehending pitch detection and note segmentation from audio samples, inexact melody matching and search.

The architecture of this prototype is presented, as well as the details of its components, showing the data flow and presenting the results of each phase of the process. A major focus is given to the adaptive comparison component, nevertheless, the work still presents a prototype which may validate the proposed concepts, besides that, it enables the evaluation of the process performance as whole.
